## 🧠 Overview

**Smart Detector: Face & Traffic** is a real-time AI-powered surveillance system that combines facial recognition and traffic monitoring in one unified platform.

### 🔍 Core Functionalities:

* 👤 **Face Detection**
  Utilizes OpenCV's **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect human faces from images or video streams.

* 🚗 **Vehicle Detection**
  Detects various vehicle types using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)**, a fast and accurate object detection model.

* 🛰️ **Object Tracking**
  Assigns unique IDs and tracks detected vehicles across frames using the **SORT** (Simple Online Realtime Tracking) algorithm.

* 📊 **Vehicle Counting**
  Maintains real-time counts of detected and tracked vehicles for traffic analysis.
